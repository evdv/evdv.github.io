Hi! I'm Emelie (pronunciation /'ɛməli:/, [howto][https://www.howtopronounce.com/emelie]), pronouns she/her.
My name comes from the Flemish part of Belgium, which is where I grew up.
So far, I have also lived in Cambridge, York, London, and Edinburgh, all in the UK, but I look forward to exploring other parts of the world.
The best part of moving around is getting to make new friends, which I really love!

In my spare time I love to dance, sing, playing piano, learning a language, listening to true crime podcasts, or finding a great TV series or documentary to dig in to.
My favourite meal is lunch, but I hate surprise raisins :(
Other things I'm passionate about are feminism, mental health, nature rewilding, sleep, the power of silly comedy, and eurovision.
