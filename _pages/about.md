Hi! I'm Emelie (pronunciation, <a href="https://www.howtopronounce.com/emelie" id="textlinks">/'ɛməli:/</a>), pronouns she/her.

Van De Vreken, my last name, comes from the Flemish part of Belgium, which is where I grew up.
So far, I have also lived in Cambridge, York, London, and Edinburgh, all in the UK, but I look forward to exploring other parts of the world.
The best part of moving around is getting to make new friends, which I really enjoy!

Currently I am a PhD student at the <a href="https://web.inf.ed.ac.uk/cdt/natural-language-processing" id="textlinks">CDT for NLP</a> at the University of Edinburgh.

In my spare time I love to dance, sing, playing piano, learning a language, listening to true crime podcasts, or finding a great TV series or documentary to dig in to.
My favourite meal is lunch, but I hate surprise raisins :(

Other things I'm passionate about are feminism, mental health, nature rewilding, sleep, the power of silly comedy, and the Eurovision Song Contest!
